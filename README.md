## What's this?
This is my personal README. The **aim of this document is to**:

* Crystallise my thoughts and identify my most important values and principles in relation to work.
* Help my colleagues understand me better as a person and work together more efficiently and effectively. 

The **aim of this document is not to**:
* To judge or state how my colleagues should think or act. I appreciate and respect if others think or work differently. 

This document is work in progress, just like me. I am human and I make mistakes. Thus, I encourage my colleagues to hold me accountable and challenge my values and principles, as this allows me to improve myself as a colleague and person. 

## About me
Things you should know about me:
* **I am a [slow thinker](https://sivers.org/slow)**: If you have a challenging question, I can try to  directly answer, but I believe my input is most valuable if I thoughtfully reflect and get back to you. 
* **I do weird things to improve my productivity**: I engage in certain habits that I believe help my productivity, but that can come across a bit weird, such as fasting daily for a period of 16 hours a day, taking a handful supplements everyday or doing some breathing exercises in between coffee breaks.
* **I can come across as an extravert, but I perceive myself more as an introvert**:  Social interaction brings spice to my life. Nonetheless, I need my quiet time in order to reflect on my thoughts and feelings and recharge my energy levels.
* **I speak my mind**: Saying things out loud is often a way for me to connect the dots in my head and learn. This doesn’t mean that it always make sense what I say, so encourage others to challenge my thoughts so I can learn. 

##  What I believe in
* **[Deep Work](https://evernote.com/blog/why-deep-work-matters-in-a-distracted-world/)**: I believe that work improves with the level of concentration, and that our current environment (including open work spaces and distracting phones) have made it more difficult to engage in ‘Deep Work'. To channel my attention I may put on my headphones, move to a quiet space and do not priotize maintaining my inbox. 
* **Reflection**: Because of time-pressure or following opinions like 'because we’ve always done it that way’, I believe it easy to get caught up in tasks or activities without spending a lot of thought on the why and the how. Pritioizing time for reflection allows me to deconstruct the why and who in order to work more focused towards a certain goal and maximise my learnings.
* **[Growth Mindset](https://hbr.org/2016/01/what-having-a-growth-mindset-actually-means)**: I believe in having a Growth Mindset. I don't believe that qualities are carved in stone, but instead that by working hard, learning from others and accepting that you don't know everything, people can transition from a nobody to an expert. 

## What I value most in a team/company
* **Having it's user as their north star**: I believe in working in a “user first” mentality, instead of a “features-first” ethos. This allows you to solve real problems for real people instead of building a few features here and there. 
* **Empathy and active listening**:  It triggers me if I have the feeling that someone is not actively listening others or me. Having empathy allows you to connect with your customers, create better products and be a better team. 
* **Critical thinking and open discussions**: I don’t fit in culture that takes decisions“ because we always did it like that”. In contrast, I do enjoy working in an environment in which  people are encouraged to share thoughts, ideas and questions, and that has employees that engage in passionate discussion in which everybody has the feeling he/she can contribute, be heard and feel respected. 
* **Learning**:  Learning new things makes me happy, so it is essential for me to work in an environment where learning and personal development is emphasised.
